1. Extract this ZIP into a folder.
2. Open "${appFile}" in a modern browser, or use the included
   Windows, macOS or Linux launcher.

No installation, server or internet connection is needed for the lessons.
The teaching language is German with original English practice materials.
Progress and drafts stay in this browser. Some file:// browsers restrict
local storage; the app explains when saving is unavailable.

Level 1 counts towards core progress; Level 2 adds transfer practice.
The visual workshop and Level 1 tasks count towards core progress.
Listening uses only an already installed English voice. If none is available,
a partner can read the accessible transcript. Source links need internet.

The 120 linked ZAM cards are prepared in cell.json.
Using this offline app does not change a personal ZAM library.
